# dio_flutter_transformer2 [![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/dio_flutter_transformer2.svg?style=flat-square)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/dio_flutter_transformer2)

A [dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio) transformer especially for flutter, by which the json decoding will be in background with [compute] function.

This package is a fork of [dio_flutter_transformer](https://pub.dev/packages/dio_flutter_transformer) which is no longer maintained.

> Through practical experience, we find that although using `compute` can make tasks go on in the background, it may lead to slow task execution. So please think carefully before using it.
